#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
- Predict customer churn at Telco, a telecommunications company, using a machine learning classification model, u

#### GOALS 

- Find drivers for customer churn at Telco.

- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.

- Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report

#### PROJECT PLANNIG

- Acquire data from the Codeup Database using my own function to automate this process. this function is saved in acquire.py file to import into the Final Report Notebook.
- Clean and prepare data for preparation step. Create a function to automate the process. The function is saved in a prepare.py module. Use the function in Final Report Notebook.
- Define two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed,document findings and takeaways.
- Establish a baseline accuracy and document well.
- Train three different classification models.
- Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.
- Choose the model that performs the best.
- Evaluate the best model (only one) on the test dataset
- Create csv file with customer_id, probability of churn, and prediction of churn

#### AUDIENCE 
- Codeup Data Science team

#### INITIAL IDEAS/ HYPOTHESES STATED
- ùêªùëú : There is no difference in churn rate between customers with 1 month of tenure  and the customers longer tenure
- ùêªùëé : There is a difference in churn rate between customers with 1 month of tenure  and the customers with longer tenure

#### INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECREATING PROJECT

- [x] Read this README.md
- [ ] Create a env.py file that has (user, host, password) in order to  get the database 
- [ ] Download the aquire.py, prepare.py, model_func.py, explore.py and  final_notebook_project.ipynb into your working directory
- [ ] Run the final_notebook_project.ipynb notebook


#### DELIVER:
- a Jupyter Notebook Report showing process and analysis with goal of finding drivers for customer churn.
- a README.md file containing project description with goals, a data dictionary, project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline), instructions or an explanation of how someone else can recreate your project and findings (What would someone need to be able to recreate your project on their own?), and key findings and takeaways from your project.
- a CSV file with customer_id, probability of churn, and prediction of churn. 
- individual modules, .py files, that hold your functions to acquire and prepare your data.
- a notebook walkthrough presentation with a high-level overview of your project (5 minutes max).
